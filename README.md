# Wish-List---Code-Bar
I made this using a tutorial from codebar: https://github.com/codebar
The tutorial can be found here: https://github.com/codebar/tutorials/blob/gh-pages/js/lesson3/tutorial.md

Basically you type in a thing and click a button to add it to your wish list.
A pending box will appear. If you click it, it changes to complete.
You may then smile for a brief moment.
